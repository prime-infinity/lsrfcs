# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing LaserFocus productivity app's user interface to provide a more visually appealing, professional, and user-friendly experience. The current UI is functional but appears bland and bare-bones. This enhancement will add modern styling, improved layout, better color schemes, helpful explanations, and privacy features for blocked website management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the LaserFocus app, I want a visually appealing and modern interface, so that the app feels professional and pleasant to use during my work sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the interface SHALL display a modern color scheme with appropriate contrast ratios
2. WHEN viewing the main window THEN the layout SHALL use proper spacing, margins, and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN interacting with controls THEN buttons and UI elements SHALL have hover effects and visual feedback
4. WHEN the app is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent typography and font sizing throughout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear explanations and guidance within the app, so that I understand what each feature does and how to use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main interface THEN there SHALL be descriptive text explaining the purpose of each major section
2. WHEN hovering over controls THEN tooltips SHALL provide additional context about functionality
3. WHEN the monitoring is enabled/disabled THEN clear status indicators SHALL show the current state
4. WHEN viewing process lists THEN column headers SHALL clearly indicate what information is displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want the ability to hide blocked website addresses from view, so that sensitive or embarrassing website names are not visible to others who might see my screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the blocked websites section THEN website addresses SHALL be hidden by default (showing placeholder text or masked content)
2. WHEN I want to see the actual websites THEN there SHALL be a "Show Blocked Websites" button to reveal the addresses
3. WHEN the websites are visible THEN there SHALL be a "Hide Blocked Websites" button to conceal them again
4. WHEN websites are hidden THEN the list SHALL still show the count of blocked websites
5. WHEN adding or removing websites THEN the visibility state SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual organization of the interface, so that I can quickly find and use the features I need without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main window THEN related controls SHALL be grouped together in logical sections
2. WHEN looking at the interface THEN there SHALL be clear visual separation between different functional areas
3. WHEN the window is resized THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately while maintaining usability
4. WHEN viewing lists and data THEN alternating row colors or other visual aids SHALL improve readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a cohesive visual theme, so that it feels like a polished, professional application rather than a basic utility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN all UI elements SHALL follow a consistent design language
2. WHEN viewing different sections THEN colors, fonts, and styling SHALL be harmonious throughout
3. WHEN the app is running THEN it SHALL have appropriate icons and visual elements that enhance the user experience
