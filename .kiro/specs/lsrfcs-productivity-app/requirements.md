# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Laser Focus (lsrfcs) productivity app is a Windows desktop application designed to help developers maintain focus by blocking distracting websites system-wide and automatically closing non-essential applications. The app provides a simple, clean interface for managing blocked websites and allowed applications, with an easy on/off toggle for all monitoring features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to block specific websites system-wide, so that I cannot access distracting sites like YouTube even in incognito mode or different browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a website to the blocked list THEN the system SHALL prevent access to that website across all browsers
2. WHEN I try to access a blocked website THEN the system SHALL redirect the request to localhost (127.0.0.1)
3. WHEN I access a blocked website in incognito mode THEN the system SHALL still block the website
4. WHEN I remove a website from the blocked list THEN the system SHALL restore normal access to that website
5. IF the app lacks administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL display an error message requesting elevated permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically close non-essential applications, so that only my development tools (VS Code, Chrome, and Kiro) remain running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is active AND a non-allowed application is launched THEN the system SHALL automatically terminate that application
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL allow Chrome, VS Code, and Kiro to run without interference
3. WHEN I add an application to the allowed list THEN the system SHALL not terminate that application during monitoring
4. WHEN I remove an application from the allowed list THEN the system SHALL terminate instances of that application if monitoring is active
5. WHEN the system cannot terminate a process THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue monitoring other processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple on/off button to control all monitoring features, so that I can quickly enable or disable focus mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Start Monitoring" THEN the system SHALL activate both website blocking and application monitoring
2. WHEN I click "Stop Monitoring" THEN the system SHALL deactivate application monitoring but keep website blocks in place
3. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the Start button SHALL be disabled and the Stop button SHALL be enabled
4. WHEN monitoring is inactive THEN the Stop button SHALL be disabled and the Start button SHALL be enabled
5. WHEN I start monitoring THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of currently running processes and their status, so that I can monitor what applications are being allowed or blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL display a real-time list of running user processes
2. WHEN a process is allowed THEN the system SHALL display it with green status text
3. WHEN a process is blocked THEN the system SHALL display it with red status text before terminating it
4. WHEN monitoring is stopped THEN the system SHALL clear the process list display
5. WHEN the process list updates THEN the system SHALL refresh every 2 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my blocked websites through a simple interface, so that I can easily add or remove sites from the block list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a website URL and click "Block Website" THEN the system SHALL add it to the blocked list
2. WHEN I enter an invalid or empty website URL THEN the system SHALL display an error message
3. WHEN I try to add a website that's already blocked THEN the system SHALL display an informational message
4. WHEN I click "Remove" next to a blocked website THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and restore access
5. WHEN I add or remove a website THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean, simple interface, so that I can focus on productivity without UI distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application THEN the system SHALL display a centered window with clear sections for website blocking and process monitoring
2. WHEN I interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all actions
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all UI elements in a logical, organized layout
4. WHEN I resize the window THEN the system SHALL maintain proper element proportions and readability
5. IF the interface becomes cluttered THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential controls and information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to require administrator privileges, so that it can modify system files and terminate processes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts without administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL request elevation or display appropriate warnings
2. WHEN the application has administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL be able to modify the Windows hosts file
3. WHEN the application has administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL be able to terminate user processes
4. IF elevation is denied THEN the system SHALL continue running with limited functionality and clear error messages
5. WHEN administrator privileges are obtained THEN the system SHALL enable all blocking and monitoring features
